# ComfyUI HY-World 2.0 — WorldMirror 3D

I made changes to the WorldStereo nodes to integrate them into the workflow. This should, in theory, fix the shadowed or black holes in the gaussian splat. However, the render times are ridiculous, and I haven't been able to fully test it. 

If you have the ability to make the project run faster—either by quantizing the models or cleaning up the code—please do so. I believe the community would be incredibly grateful.

## Installation

### Via ComfyUI Manager (recommended)

Search for **HY-World 2.0** and click Install. `requirements.txt` and `install.py` run automatically.

`install.py` will attempt to install `gsplat` — first from a pre-built wheel, then by compiling from source if no wheel is available for your platform.

### Manual

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/AHEKOT/ComfyUI_HYWorld2
cd ComfyUI_HYWorld2
pip install -r requirements.txt
python install.py
```

## gsplat — Requirements for Compilation

`gsplat` is a CUDA extension and cannot always be installed from a pre-built wheel. If your Python version, PyTorch version, or CUDA version is not covered by an official wheel, it must be compiled from source.

The `install.py` script handles this automatically, but the following tools must be present on the system.

### Required

**1. CUDA Toolkit**

Install the CUDA Toolkit version that matches your PyTorch build:

```
PyTorch CUDA version  →  Required CUDA Toolkit
cu118                 →  CUDA 11.8
cu121                 →  CUDA 12.1
cu124                 →  CUDA 12.4
```

Download: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive

After installation, verify:
```
nvcc --version
```

**2. MSVC C++ Compiler (Windows only)**

Install **Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 or 2022** with the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/

After installation, verify (from a Developer Command Prompt):
```
cl
```

If neither system MSVC nor a portable compiler is found, the build script will attempt to download a portable MSVC automatically (~600 MB).

**3. Git**

Required to clone the gsplat source repository if no pre-built wheel is available.

```
git --version
```

### Optional

- **ninja** — speeds up compilation significantly. Installed automatically by the build script if missing.

### Pre-built wheels (no compilation needed)

If a wheel exists for your exact combination of Python / PyTorch / CUDA, the build script will use it instead of compiling. Check availability at:

https://docs.gsplat.studio/whl/

### Manual build

To run the gsplat build independently:

```bash
# Windows
scripts\pipinstall.bat

# Any platform
python scripts/build_gsplat.py
```

## Workflows

Example workflows are in the `workflows/` directory:

- `World-single-image.json` — single image to 3D scene
- `World-Mirror-panorama.json` — equirectangular panorama to 3D scene

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch with CUDA
- NVIDIA GPU (gsplat rendering requires CUDA)
- Flash Attention — required for HY-World 2.0 model inference. Install via:
  ```
  pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
  ```
